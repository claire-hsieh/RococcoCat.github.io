The Goldfinch\nEvery page of this hefty tome is a work of art. Reading this book was about as easy as watching a movie, absolutely seamless transition from the page to a visual in your mind. It\u0026rsquo;s beautiful to see a (very human, very flawed) character grow up, admist tragedies, build friendships, some fleeting and some life-changing, and eventually just navigate life. Which all sounds very cliche and overdone in the bildungsroman genre, but what I think the Goldfinch does best is that Theo, the protagonist, is never made out to be especially talented or\n2. Ender\u0026rsquo;s Game\nControversial opionion but I think Speaker for the Dead was actually a really good book and the first time I read it, I thought it was better than Ender\u0026rsquo;s Game. But now I\u0026rsquo;ve matured a little and realize that Ender\u0026rsquo;s Game is an absolute masterpiece and can\u0026rsquo;t be topped. :)\n3. Wind, Sand, and Stars\nYou would think a book written by a French pilot with a plane on the cover would primarily be about aircraft and flight and you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be wrong but it\u0026rsquo;s more than that. For St. Exupery, the plane is a tool, somehow removing him from the rest of humanity but at the same time bringing him closer to other people and to nature. Wherever he goes, his focus always swings back to the people and unbridled wilderness of mother nature. He steps closer to death and danger than just about anyone has in this day and age. Safely cloistered in the suburbs of California where it\u0026rsquo;s relatively temperate year round, the thought of facing bitter, hypothermia inducing cold and cyclone-level winds with only the thin walls of a plane between him and the elements makes me re-evaluate my entire view on civilization and how far we\u0026rsquo;ve come.\nThis is beautiful book and every page makes you want to sink into his story and just marvel at the world. Written in the 30s, the world as more disconnected then but he voices the same fears that people have now of machines and their displacement of people. But then, and even more so now, technology brings people together in ways that we couldn\u0026rsquo;t imagine a few hundred years ago. Telegrams allowing us to communicate across oceans and smartphones giving us access to friends and family at any hour of the day. The most poignant part of this book was the simple realization that as incredible as modern innovations can be, the only thing that really matters is other people and the relationships we form along the way, which sounds cheesy but I think it\u0026rsquo;s very true and I would hate to forget that.\n4. The Name of the Wind\nWaiting for book 3 is killing me.\n5. Into the Wild\nI think about this book every so often when life feels like it\u0026rsquo;s getting to be a bit much and I feel the overwhelming urge to just escape into the California wilderness surviving on acorns and wild onions.\n6. Normal People\nThe reminder that communication mishaps are just part of life and sometimes you\u0026rsquo;ll feel lonely and oh so misunderstood.\n7. A Deadly Education\nMy guilty pleasure. YA at its finest.\n8. Dark Age\nThe best military, sci-fi novel of the 21st century at least until book 6 comes out. A non-stop thriller where all your favorite characters will inevitably be punished by the whims of bad luck and sadistic, antagonists only Pierce Brown is able to dream up.\n9. The Secret History\nAgain, Donna Tartt is a phenomenal writer so she has two books on my top ten list.\n10. The Gene: An Intimate History\nThe start of my career as a geneticist. Thank you Dr. Mukherjee.\nGoodreads\n","date":"April 22, 2023","hero":"/images/posts/strawberries-7391738__480.jpg","permalink":"http://roccococat.github.io/posts/books/","summary":"My top ten books:\n1.
