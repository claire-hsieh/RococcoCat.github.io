[{"categories":null,"contents":"My top ten books:\n1. The Goldfinch\nEvery page of this hefty tome is a work of art. I honestly can\u0026rsquo;t think of a book with scenes that are so beautifully designed. Reading this book was about as easy as watching a movie, absolutely seamless transition from the page to a visual in your mind.\n2. Ender\u0026rsquo;s Game\nControversial opionion but I think Speaker for the Dead was actually a really good book and the first time I read it, I thought it was better than Ender\u0026rsquo;s Game. But now I\u0026rsquo;ve matured a little and realize that Ender\u0026rsquo;s Game is an absolute masterpiece and can\u0026rsquo;t be topped. :)\n3. Wind, Sand, and Stars\nRead to discover the meaning of life.\n4. The Name of the Wind\nWaiting for book 3 is killing me.\n5. Into the Wild\nI think about this book every so often when life feels like it\u0026rsquo;s getting to be a bit much and I feel the overwhelming urge to just escape into the California wilderness surviving on acorns and wild onions.\n6. Normal People\n7. A Deadly Education\n8. Dark Age\n9. The Secret History\n10. The Gene: An Intimate History The start of my career as a geneticist. Thank you Dr. Mukherjee.\nGoodreads\n","date":"April 22, 2023","hero":"/images/posts/strawberries-7391738__480.jpg","permalink":"http://roccococat.github.io/posts/books/","summary":"My top ten books:\n1.
