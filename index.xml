1. The Goldfinch
Every page of this hefty tome is a work of art. I honestly can&amp;rsquo;t think of a book with scenes that are so beautifully designed. Reading this book was about as easy as watching a movie, absolutely seamless transition from the page to a visual in your mind.
2. Ender&amp;rsquo;s Game
Controversial opionion but I think Speaker for the Dead was actually a really good book and the first time I read it, I thought it was better than Ender&amp;rsquo;s Game.</description></item><item><title>Introduction</title><link>http://roccococat.github.io/posts/introduction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jun 2020 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>http://roccococat.github.io/posts/introduction/</guid><description>Greeting!
