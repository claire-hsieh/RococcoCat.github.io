My top ten books: 

**1. The Goldfinch**  

Every page of this hefty tome is a work of art. I honestly can't think of a book with scenes that are so beautifully designed. Reading this book was about as easy as watching a movie, absolutely seamless transition from the page to a visual in your mind. 

**2. Ender's Game**

Controversial opionion but I think Speaker for the Dead was actually a really good book and the first time I read it, I thought it was better than Ender's Game. But now I've matured a little and realize that Ender's Game is an absolute masterpiece and can't be topped. :)

**3. Wind, Sand, and Stars** 

Read to discover the meaning of life.

**4. The Name of the Wind**

Waiting for book 3 is killing me. 

**5. Into the Wild**

I think about this book every so often when life feels like it's getting to be a bit much and I feel the overwhelming urge to just escape into the California wilderness surviving on acorns and wild onions. 

**6. Normal People**

The reminder that communication mishaps are just part of life and sometimes you'll feel lonely and oh so misunderstood. 

**7. A Deadly Education**

My guilty pleasure. YA at its finest. 
  
**8. Dark Age**

The best military, sci-fi novel of the 21st century at least until book 6 comes out. A non-stop thriller where all your favorite characters will inevitably be punished by the whims of bad luck and sadistic, antagonists only Pierce Brown is able to dream up. 

**9. The Secret History**

Again, Donna Tartt is a *phenomenal* writer so she has **two** books on my top ten list.  

**10. The Gene: An Intimate History**

The start of my career as a geneticist. Thank you Dr. Mukherjee.
