My top ten books: 

__1. The Goldfinch__  
Every page of this hefty tome is a work of art. I honestly can't think of a book with scenes that are so beautifully designed. Reading this book was about as easy as watching a movie, absolutely seamless transition from the page to a visual in your mind. 

__2. Ender's Game__  
Controversial opionion but I think Speaker for the Dead was actually a really good book and the first time I read it, I thought it was better than Ender's Game. But now I've matured a little and realize that Ender's Game is an absolute masterpiece and can't be topped. :)

__3. Wind, Sand, and Stars__  
Read to discover the meaning of life.

__4. The Name of the Wind__  
Waiting for book 3 is killing me. 

__5. Into the Wild__  
I think about this book every so often when life feels like it's getting to be a bit much and I feel the overwhelming urge to just escape into the California wilderness surviving on acorns and wild onions. 

__6. Normal People__  
__7. A Deadly Education__  
__8. Dark Age__  
__9. The Secret History__  
__10. The Gene: An Intimate History__    
The start of my career as a geneticist. Thank you Dr. Mukherjee.
