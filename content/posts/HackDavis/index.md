Our project for HackDavis 2023:

(Trouble in Moo Town)[https://saisuresh2.github.io/davis_adventure_game/]

This project was inspired by our desire to build a game that would encourage folks to go outside and appreciate our beautiful campus. We decided to integrate this idea with a tour-like game that would help incoming freshmen and transfers navigate our huge campus!


Made in collaboration with Sai Suresh, Jenna Noueihed, and Meghana Manepalli.
